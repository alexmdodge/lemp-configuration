# LEMP Stack Configuration and Tooling
This LEMP configuration is designed to simplify the creation of a basic web server
with secure HTTPS as well as other secure features. Primarily intended for
use in an AWS setting, but applicable anywhere. It also comes bundled with a
couple of tools to help with configuring different aspects of the stack.

# Server Setup
First spin up a server instance however you like. You will need access to the
command line. Some shared services do not allow this which is why AWS and Digital Ocean are convenient. SSH into the server then ensure you have `wget` installed,

```sh
wget https://github.com/alexmdodge/lemp-configuration/archive/v1.0.0.tar.gz
tar -xzf lemp-configuration.tar.gz
```

This will download and unpack the tar file which contains all of the tooling.

If you have made edits and would like to re-pack the configuration for ease of moving
between servers and workstations (without git dependency) run,

```sh
./build.sh
```
which simply wraps everything up in a new tar ball.

# Setup
Begin by running the server installation script,

```sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```
This will configure,
* Nginx
* PHP-FPM
* Recommended webserver Nginx settings and restrictions
* Install `letsencrypt`
* Prepare server to add individual site instances

# Create
Once you have successfully setup the site you should be able to visit the
public ip address and see a welcome page which has a title and shows information
about the php configuration.

Note that later on once another site is created with public page will be
removed as it is not fit for public facing production instances.

Before you begin make sure you have the domain name setup. This can be done
through any third party, or through Amazon Route 53. To begin the creation
script run,

```sh
./creator.sh
```

This will walk you through all the necessary steps. After the site configuration
is successfully in place
